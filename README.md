# Lessons Learned
This application was very exciting! It is the culmination of four days of learning. I am happy to effectively pulled from a database. In preparing for and completing the project I learned how to apply SQL commands in methods within Java Classes, applied interfaces, and most impressive, I realized that I know a lot more about coding in Java than I thought I did!
